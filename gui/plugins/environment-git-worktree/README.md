# Worktree

Creates an isolated Git worktree from the project checkout on an enrolled machine. The plugin supplies base-branch inputs, runs workspace setup, and removes owned worktrees after core retires them. Project sub-threads receive fresh worktrees by default. Local forks with a named base branch from the CLI, SDK or a plugin use the thread's repo when it differs from the project's (`sourcePath` input). The app's branch picker keeps using the project's repo.

Bundled and installed automatically. Select it through the environment picker or `bb thread spawn --environment-provider git-worktree`. Use `bb environment providers --json` for its inputs and availability.

The Plugin Guide documents the experimental environment-provider contract. Core owns durable launches, retries, cancellation, retirement, and teardown; this plugin owns resource creation and removal.
